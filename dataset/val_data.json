{"output":"Artificial neural networks are the most commonly used deep learning models because they are able to approximate non-linear functions. They structure their operations as a network of nodes and can accurately process complex data inputs more accurately than traditional machine learning algorithms. Additionally, they have the ability to self-adjust their parameters, making them better able to understand and learn from complex data.","instruction":"Explain why artificial neural networks are the most commonly used deep learning models.","input":""}

Depending on the height of the cliff, they could experience a free fall of several seconds before hitting the ground. If they do not jump far enough away from the cliff, they could also hit the rocks and cause serious injuries.","instruction":"Describe what would happen if a person jumps off a cliff","input":"No input"}
